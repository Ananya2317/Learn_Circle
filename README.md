# Learn_Circle
LearnCircle is a lightweight learning platform built around small, skill-focused learning circles. Each circle is created by someone who wants to share knowledge—whether through notes, links, tutorials, or curated study materials. Students join these circles to access resources, stay organized, and learn together.

# How It Works
1. Anyone can start a learning circle by uploading study materials or linking helpful resources. The more useful and active a circle becomes, the more recognition its creator earns.

2. Students follow circles that match their interests or skill goals. Inside each circle, members can:
- Access shared notes and content
- Complete tasks or mini-assignments
- Chat with others learning the same topic
- Earn Recognition and Rewards

3. When a circle grows or its materials get used consistently, the creator is rewarded. This can include:
- Points that track contribution
- Badges and achievement levels
- A reputation score within the platform
- Potential monetisation opportunities in the future
This reward system encourages creators to continually improve their content, while learners benefit from higher-quality resources.

# Why LearnCircle?

Community-first learning: Small groups make collaboration natural and less overwhelming.

Encouraged contribution: Creators stay motivated because their work is recognised.

Skill-based growth: Every circle focuses on a specific topic or ability, helping learners stay on track.

Future-ready: The reward system aims to grow into a full creator-economy model for educational content.

LearnCircle aims to make study communities more meaningful, resource-driven, and rewarding for everyone involved.
